To learn more about connection pools and connection pooling, be sure to check out [Prisma's Data Guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/database-tools/connection-pooling) for a comprehensive overview on what connection pooling is, what it seeks to address, and how it works.

For more information about the internal connection pool of Prisma ORM specifically, see our [ORM connection pooling documentation](/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/databases-connections/connection-pool).

Accelerate provides built-in connection pooling by default. By using Accelerate, you get the benefits of connection pooling without having to configure anything. The efficient management of database connections allows the database to process more queries without exhausting the available database connections, making your application more scalable.

In some cases, however, it may be beneficial to further configure connection pooling in order to optimize the performance of your application.

### Connection Pooling in Accelerate

By default, Accelerate has a default connection limit of `10`. In most cases, this connection limit is sufficient. However, in high traffic or compute environments, you may need to [increase this value](#configuring-the-connection-pool-size). For the [Pro plan](https://prisma.io/pricing) there is a maximum connection limit of `100`. For [Business plan](https://prisma.io/pricing) users the maximum is `1000`.

### Configuring the connection pool size

The connection pool size can be configured in your Platform project via the `Connection limit` setting. For example, set a connection pool size of `10` like this:

If nothing is configured, the default value of `10` will be used.

To change the size of the connection pool:
1. Open the [Console](https://console.prisma.io/login).
1. Select the _project_ in which you're using Accelerate. You might need to select a different _workspace_ if you can't see your project.
1. Select the _environment_ where you want to configure Accelerate's connection pool size.
1. Update the connection limit via the `Connection limit` setting.

#### Autoscaling

Autoscaling allows Accelerate to allocate resources to scale up or down based on the traffic to your application. Specifically, Accelerate will begin allocating new resources when you have consistent usage greater than 90% of your currently alloted connection limit. If traffic continues to increase, Accelerate will scale up further. If traffic decreases, Accelerate will scale down.

Autoscaling is enabled when the Accelerate connection limit is set higher than `10`. Autoscaling is not available on the [Starter plan](https://prisma.io/pricing).

The maximum value of your Accelerate connection limit is based on your [Prisma Data Platform plan](https://prisma.io/pricing). 

| Plan       | Maximum Connection Limit             |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Starter    | 10                                   |
| Pro        | 100                                  |
| Business   | 1000                                 |

### Configuring the connection pool timeout

The connection pool timeout is the maximum number of seconds that a query will block while waiting for a connection from Accelerate's internal connection pool. This occurs if the number of concurrent requests exceeds the connection limit, resulting in queueing of additional requests until a free connection becomes available. An exception is thrown if a free connection does not become available within the pool timeout. The connection pool timeout can be disabled by setting the value to 0.

Similar to the connection pool size, you may also configure the connection pool timeout via the _database connection string_. To adjust this value, you may add the `pool_timeout` parameter to the database connection string.

For example:

```env no-copy
postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db?connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=20
```

The default value for `pool_timeout` is `10` seconds.
